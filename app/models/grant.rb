# A Grant represents the period in which a client can log a user back in with an immediate redirect,
# not requiring explicit user interaction.  As such, a Grant only applies to clients using the
# Implicit Grant or Authorization Code Grant.
#
# The Grant is limited to a set of scopes, and if you request more scopes in a reauthorization
# request, the flow will still require user interaction.
#
# Grants will only be issued if a client has been configured with an HTTPS Redirect URI, otherwise
# it creates a significant security hole for any client using a non-confidential setup.
